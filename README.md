# AsyncAPI 
[![Rust](https://github.com/open-home-dev/asyncapi/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/open-home-dev/asyncapi/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

This crate aims to provide data structures that represent the [AsyncAPI v 2.3.0 specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.3.0).

This crate is still in an early development stage. The official valid test files are all parsed without errors.

This crate builds upon the work for the [openapiv3 crate](https://crates.io/crates/openapiv3) and adapts it for the AsyncAPI specification.
