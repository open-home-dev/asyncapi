# AsyncAPI

This crate aims to provide data structures that represent the [AsyncAPI v 2.2.0 specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.2.0).

This crate is still in an early development stage. It is yet to be tested and adapted to new versions of the specification.

This crate builds upon the work for the [openapiv3 crate](https://crates.io/crates/openapiv3) and adapts it for the AsyncAPI specification.
